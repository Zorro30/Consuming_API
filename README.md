This repo consists of code I have come across while learning about consuming an API.

=> [consuming_API.py](https://github.com/Zorro30/Consuming_API/blob/master/consuming_api.py)
This code queries a simple API to retrieve data about the International Space Station (ISS) like the number of people present at ISS and their name.

=>[consuming_twitter_api.py](https://github.com/Zorro30/Consuming_API/blob/master/consuming_twitter_api.py)
1) For accessing twitter api, first go to [Twitter Apps page](https://apps.twitter.com)
2) Click on Create New App (you need to be logged in to Twitter to access this page).
3)Locate the Keys and Access Tokens Tab and create your access token.
4) And place Access token, Access Token secret, Consumer Key and Consumer Secret to respective placeholders.
